This small application build with React is part of an excercise I have done for an interview.
The application fetches some users info (Using Axios library) from the following API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
UseState, UseEffect and useParams hooks are used.
I have left a few notes inside the code so to explain a bit the logic behind it.
